Hello I Push my changes we mentioned on the DotNet Developer Assessment file..
please run the database script first and do the changes in Connection string .. 

I tried to cover the all points that mentioned in the file.. but due to the Time Limit of 8 hours, I am able to create a Database with some normalization along with
CREATE record , LIST Record by Sorting Order with Responsive design
and About the MAP functionality I created a Action Method and also try to get that Latitude and Longitude  but due to KEY restriction I am unable to further process..



Architecture :::::::::::

in solution I created a Repository Design Pattern 

used stored proc to get and Insert the Contact data.. also created a DotNetAssessmentKnila.API to create a API to get and set the Data into the database..
